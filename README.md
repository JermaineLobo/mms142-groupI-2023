<h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
</p>
<p>Augmented Reality is defined as either a real-time direct, or indirect view of a physical real-world environment enhanced by adding computer-generated information.
With the help of technology, digital images and information may now be
shown in the real world using augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality will become the new interface
between humans and machines, bridging the digital and physical worlds.</p>
<h1>The Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</h1>
<p>At first glance, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality may seem the same, the distinctions between the two come down to the devices required to both experiences. </p>
<h1>How Does Augmented Reality Work?</h1>
<p>Ivan Sutherland, a computer scientist, known as the "Father of Computer Graphics," developed the first
augmented reality (AR) system in 1968 at Harvard. The universities, businesses, and government
organizations continued to enhance augmented reality for wearables and digital displays throughout the
ensuing decades. In fact, Pokémon Go is a 2016 augmented reality game in which players travel through the
real world while following a digital map in search of cartoon creatures that appear at random. It's getting
wider and wider. Businesses such as Ikea and Loreal, to name a few, use augmented reality to help consumers
make a decision about buying their products and, at the same time, boost businesses’ sales. The business can
decrease return rates and increase customer satisfaction by enabling users to test out a significant purchase
using augmented reality. In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles. Moreover, the augmented reality (AR) movement
is booming, and it is predicted that 2.4 billion mobile users will use AR globally by 2023, according to Shweta
Sinha research study. Another important field where this technology might shine is education. Due to AR's
ability to let teachers add gaming aspects to enhance textbook material and demonstrate virtual instances of
concepts, classroom learning can become more engaging and remarkable to student</p>
