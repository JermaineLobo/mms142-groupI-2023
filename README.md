<h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
<p>Augmented Reality is defined as either a real-time direct, or indirect view of a physical real-world environment enhanced by adding computer-generated information.
With the help of technology, digital images and information may now be
shown in the real world using augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality will become the new interface
between humans and machines, bridging the digital and physical worlds.</p>

<h1>The Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</h1>
<p>At first glance, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality may seem the same, and easy to mix up the two, there are actually some key difference between both. The main difference being that AR uses a real world setting, and allows its user to control their presence in the real world, while in VR, it is completely virtual, and is controlled by a system. In addition, AR enchance both the virtual and real world, while VR only enchances a fictional reality.</p>

<h1>How Does Augmented Reality Work?</h1>
<p>Computer scientist, Ivan Sutherland, who is known as the "<i>Father of Computer Graphics</i>", developed the first
augmented reality (AR) system in 1968 at Harvard. The universities, businesses, and government
organizations continued to enhance augmented reality for wearables and digital displays throughout the
ensuing decades. Pokémon Go, released in 2016, is an example of augmented reality in use where players travel through the
real world while following a digital map in search of virtual creatures that appear at random. 
  
<p>In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles. Moreover, the augmented reality (AR) movement
is booming, and it is predicted that 2.4 billion mobile users will use AR globally by 2023, according to Shweta
Sinha research study. Another important field where this technology might shine is education. Due to AR's
ability to let teachers add gaming aspects to enhance textbook material and demonstrate virtual instances of
concepts, classroom learning can become more engaging and remarkable to student</p>

<h1>Augmented Reality as a Disruptive Technology</h1>
<p>In the age of widespread technology use, the incorportation of Augmented Reality into our daily lives prompts
concerns regarding its impact on health and safety. The continious engagements with screens facilitated by AR has
the potential to contribute to various health issues, encompassing eye diseases, mental health disorders, and problems,
related to posture.</p>

<p>As individuals immerse themselves in augmented environments, there is a risk of overlooking their immediate physical
surroundings. This is particularly evident during travel, where the use of AR navigation techniques may introduce distractions, leading to misjudgments of the speed of approaching vehicles, underestimations of reaction time, and inadvertent disregard for real-world hazards.</p>

<p>In addition, AR, along with VR, allow users to experience virtual realities in ways that were previously thought impossible, such as AR glasses allowing users
to see digital objects. Secondly, AR allows offers new ways for its users to interact both with each other, and their envrionment through immersive processes, such as apps
like Pokemon Go, which lets players explore the real world, while the game's digital creatures are overlayed on top of the environment.</p>

<p>The statement emphasizing that "<i>until something bad happens, you won't know you're at greater risk of harm</i>" underscores the critical need to comprehend and address the potential negative consequences of AR technology.</p>

<h1>Examples of Augmented Reality In Use</h1>
<p>The usage of AR is getting wider and wider. Businesses such as Ikea and L'oreal, use augmented reality to help consumers
make a decision about buying their products and, at the same time, boost businesses’ sales. The business can
decrease return rates and increase customer satisfaction by enabling users to test out a significant purchase
using augmented reality.

<p>In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles.</p>

<p>While in Healthcare, AR has become an increasingly integral part of it, signaling as ignificant technological intergration into the industry. The application of AR sppances various domains, including wearables, telemedicice, remote surgery, and mecial diagnosis. Enchancing patient care, streamline processes, and reducing costs is the primary objective of AR, and has shown notable advancements, showcasing its potential in the transformation of healtchcare services AR has also revolutionized both remote surgery and medical diagnosis by providing enchanced visualizations, precision, and interactive information overlay, enhacncing the surgeons' ability to interpret complex patient data.</p>

<p>In education, AR Books incorporate elements such as images, animation, or intarctive features superimposed on to the physcial pages when viewed from a device, such as a smartphone or tablet. According to a study on fourth and fitth-grade students founf that reading AR books increased attention, confidence, and satisfaction, highlighting the importance of providing a multisensory and interactive narrative for a better reading motivation.</p>
